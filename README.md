# Reactive programming talk

Reactive programming is a pretty hot topic lately in front-end and back-end development. It brings us a lot of benefits,
but should be used with care as it can introduce unnecessary complexity with a steep learning curve. Here we are going 
to start by looking under the hood to what reactive programming really is, we will start from front-end and move up to 
back-end and we will cover the cases of why you should use it and when.
